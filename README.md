# -ENet-LaneDetection-CPUOptimized
This project implements an efficient lane detection system using the ENet convolutional neural network, optimized for CPU-only environments. It achieves high accuracy and real-time performance, making it suitable for autonomous driving and Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS). The system is trained and evaluated on the TuSimple dataset.
